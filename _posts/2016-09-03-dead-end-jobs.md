# Dead End Jobs

For many it takes a big life changing event before realizing they have a purpose in this life even if they don't know yet what that purpose is. Many people get stuck in dead end jobs and feel discouraged to find something better. Most are afraid to try something different because they have rent and bills to keep up with.

So, unfortunately many will continue on in their robotic day to day life living on the bare minimum while unhappy with their jobs. Not to mention never enough time for friends and family. 

Once someone realizes they don't have to live this way, nor do they even want to anymore, the chains that keep them down start to loosen and break apart.
